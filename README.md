Welcome to my portfolio!

## Description:
This is my portfolio. Here you will find my personal favourite projects from my school year. I will add a small list of the languages used and/or which are relevant to the year of learning and that I am somewhat comfortable using. I feel that there is already a large improvement in my work and I look forward to increasing my knowledge in the years to come...
