        <h3>Semester Project</h3>
        <p>In this project I was tasked with making a website for a museum. There were very specific guidelines to follow, which made this 
            feel like something I would be tasked with doing if I was working for a company. The website was mostly going to be used by children,
            and for this reason I had younger siblings test the site to make sure it was easy to use and appealing.
            The main languages used were HTML and CSS but there was also some simple javascript.

        <h3>Cross-Course Assignment</h3>
        <p>The task for this project was to take the prototype I made in the previous course (design 1) and turn it into a functioning website.
            I used HTML, CSS and some simple Javascript to create this WCAG complient website. The project in itself was to make a site where people
          can buy and sell games at affordable prices. It needed to stick out, be easy to use and have a good understandable layout.</p>

        <h3>Project Exam 1</h3>
        <p>My task for the exam was to make a blog site. The blogs were going to be pulled from a Wordpress API so there was need for a lot more
            Javascript in this project. I was also challenged with adding a carousel and modal which was difficult but turned out great in my opinion. 
            This project was designed to test knowledge and see how I react to a challenge.

    <h2>Reflection on my first year</h2>
    <p>This year i have learned alot about programming and coding. I felt that I had the foundations of
        CSS and HTML pretty nailed and this made the first half of the year very easy for me.
        This meant that I did not have to stress about getting the work done as it didnt take me too long.
        I struggled coming into the second half of the year as javascript was much more difficult and I
        did not, and still do not fully understand it. I feel like i need to improve my javascript to 
        hopefully make it easier to do the tasks next year. In terms of programming i still have a lot of 
        potential to improve.</p><p> Mostly i need to be better at understanding how to use certain styles and 
        figuring out typography and which colors works for each senario. I feel that it is difficult for me to not
        go straight to black and white or very neatral colors.
        I am proud of the projects I have made so far and already I can see a huge improvement.
        I would also like to improve on my time management. For example during the cross course assignment I only spent maybe 1 of the 5 weeks
        doing the assignemt and felt that I was done. It was not bad but I could have used the full 5 weeks and made something to really stand out.
